# Point-Enclosure
 A RESTful service which accepts as a POST of JSON of an ordered list of points represented as (x, y) coordinates.  The points define the perimeter of a polygon and it returns the number of points with integer (x, y) coordinates which are fully enclosed by the polygon.  Points on the polygon itself are not included in the count.
